##REQUEST MONSTER##
Request Monster randomly fetches resources from a static file server configured with Small_SFS. Config constants at top of file.

Just run `node request_monster.js`. If the Small_SFS server is running, request_monster should start
fetching resources. It will log the type of resource (image, css, etc) to the console.

NOTE: request_monster has no visual or monitoring functionality. All request monster cares about is sending requests.
