# cdn_load_testing_toolkit
This repo provides two tools that allow users to test their CDN configurations: 
Small Sfs: an economical static file server 
Request Monster: a javascript program that issues pseudo-random requests for those static files.

Installation notes are located in the readme for both tools. small sfs is designed to run on a VPS whereas request monster can be run from your local development environment.
